##  What is System Design?
- Think For The Now
     - You're building a system, that will function now. Something that will solve a problem your users have now.
     - Yeah, it's very good to think ahead, but you can easily get lost in doing so. Instead, try to solve and think about the problems you (or your users) have now.
- Scalability
     - Think For The Now, Make Room For The Future
     - Solve the problems you have now, while not bottlenecking yourself in the future!
- Flexibility
- Reusable
     - Make sure your code is fluid
     - Don't make specific functions that do only one thing, make broad or general-purpose functions
     - Use loops when necessary, define global rules (for example, your theme), etc.
     - Make sure your code can be reused. (D.R.Y)
- Don't GO into detail Prematurely, and K.I.S.S
     - Don't dive into your design head first.
     - Take your time. Relook at things twice, thrice, ten times.
     - Don't overthink it. If something looks more complicated than it should be, it probably is.
     - Don't focus on one specific thing, take a step back and look at the whole problem. And slowly, but surely, go into detail.
